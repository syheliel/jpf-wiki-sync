The goal of the workshop is to highlight research and tools for Java/Android program verification and analysis. Although there is a
particular emphasis on the JPF tool, and on projects that use JPF to support basic research, tool development, or verification case studies, the workshop also welcomes contributions related to general program analysis of Java/Android programs. The hope is to use the workshop to grow the community of researchers investigating Java, Android, and JPF in an effort to foster collaboration and define future needs for Java program analysis.

## Call for Submissions
We solicit regular paper submissions on existing research and applications related to JPF or its extensions. If the underlying
research idea has been published in another venue, the paper needs to clarify the novel aspects that are being presented in the paper.
We also solicit extended abstracts and position paper submissions on recent work or work in progress. We welcome comparative analysis
papers that evaluate algorithms in JPF or its extensions with other relevant tools. The goal of the workshop is to encourage the flow of
ideas relevant to JPF and Java/Android program analysis in general. The papers should be at most 5 pages long in the ACM SIG
Proceedings format. The extended abstracts and position paper should be at most 2-pages. Accepted *regular papers* will be published in
the Software Engineering Notes (SEN) and the ACM digital library.

Topics of interest include the following:
* JPF extensions or tools
* JPF case studies
* Position papers on JPF, such as future directions
* Java program analysis or verification
* Android program analysis or verification
* General software verification techniques or tools

*More information about how to submit will follow soon!*

## Participation
We invite practitioners, academics, and students who are interested in Java development, automated program analysis, and related software engineering research and practice to attend the JPF workshop. Submitting a paper is not required to participate, enjoy, and learn about JPF.
