The goal of the workshop is to highlight current research and tools development for Java/Android program verification and analysis. Although the workshopâ€™s theme revolves around the JPF tool, e.g., use of JPF to support basic research, tool development, or in verification case studies, we also welcome contributions related to program analysis of Java/Android applications. The workshop will serve as a platform to grow the community of researchers, foster collaboration and define future directions for JPF development and Java/Android program analysis research.

## Call for Submissions
We solicit regular paper submissions on existing research and applications related to JPF or its extensions, as well as topics on Java/Android static analysis. We welcome comparative analysis papers that evaluate algorithms in JPF or its extensions with other relevant tools. If the underlying research idea has been published in another venue, authors need to clarify the novel aspects that are being presented in their papers. We also solicit extended abstracts and position papers on recent or in progress work. Submissions should be at most 5 pages long (including references) in the [ACM SIGSOFT SEN format](https://www.sigsoft.org/SEN/subpub.html). The extended abstracts and position paper should be at most 2-pages (including references). Accepted regular papers will be published in the Software Engineering Notes (SEN) and the ACM digital library.

Topics of interest include the following:
* JPF extensions or tools
* JPF case studies
* Position papers on JPF, such as future directions
* Java program analysis or verification
* Android program analysis or verification
* General software verification techniques or tools

All papers must be submitted electronically through the JPF 2022 EasyChair submission site: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jpf2022. All submissions must be in English.

## Participation
We invite practitioners, academics, and students who are interested in Java development, automated program analysis, and related software engineering research and practice to attend the JPF workshop. Submitting a paper is not required to participate, enjoy, and learn about JPF. The workshop will be co-located with [ASE 2022](https://conf.researchr.org/track/ase-2022/ase-2022-workshops) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States.

While we want to encourage all participants to join on-site in Ann Arbor, we want to highlight that the **JPF workshop will be held as a hybrid event**. This also means that authors are not necessarily required to present in person but can also present virtually.
